# global-terrorism-analytics
This project aims to analyse past terrorist activities and draw insights from them to predict success of future activities.
The codes have been neatly placed in notebooks to enable step by step execution to the viewers.

This repo contains the following files(so far):
  a. attack_type_analysis.ipynb : Analyses how the different mechanisms of attacks have contributed to the success
  b. Categorical_Corr.ipynb : Finds correlation between the various categorical parameters to success
  c. Visualisations.ipynb : Preliminary Exploratory Data Analysis
  d. exploratory_analysis.ipynb : EDA on various attack types
